Dear Sir/Ma,

I am OMOJOLA JOSHUA DAMILOLA with CSCS account 130081775.

I wrote earlier this month reagarding 51 units of MOBIL that's missing on my account.

Like I earlier mentioned, the volume was probably sold and the sales wasn't captured by the system, perhaps due to a network glitch.

The timeframe is from 20th March, 2020 to 26th March 2020.

Kindly help me get my CSCS statement for this period, so I can reconcile with my cashflow statement, and hopefully spot the error.

I noticed the CSCS X-ALERT is running again after weeks of interruption, so perhaps their portal will be available to get my statement now.

20th to 26th March, 2020.

Thank you.
