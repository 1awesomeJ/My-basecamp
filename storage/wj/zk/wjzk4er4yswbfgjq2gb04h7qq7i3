<h2> About </h2>
<p> As the Scriptures say, God is looking for true worshippers
who would worship the Father in Spirit and in truth.
We are a band that hopes to inspire and raise the next generation of true
worshippers-such as the father seeks.</p>
<img src ="truthers_1.jpg">
<p>
We're not fixed as a band. Our membership is always open to any vessel
that's available for God to use at any moment in time, subject to us
checking with the Holy Spirit, so one of us who leads a worship session today
may tomorrow be in the congregation to be led into worship, whereas someone
who was just in the audience at a previous meeting, could be the one leading
a current session, if they'd make themselves available for use by the Father.
